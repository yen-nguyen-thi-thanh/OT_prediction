Welcome! This repository contains `python` and `R` codes to run the algorithm, as presented in the paper *Making sparse predictions, and forecasting the requests of the government declaration of natural disaster for a drought event in France* by T. T. Y. Nguyen, G. Ecoto, A. Chambaz (2023). The paper can be found [here](). 




The Jupyter notebook `ot_sparse_pred_demo.ipynb` presents several illustrations. 

The main files of the repository are:
- `predicters.py`: the main function to predict the cost of drought event
- `utils.py`: defines key-functions used in our algorithm.
- `hp.py`: the hyperband algorithm.


The folder `simulations` contains the codes used to generate data for the experimantal study presented in the paper. The folder `datasets` contains the real data data.
